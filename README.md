    There are a few things I wanted to say and couldn't,
    because you would have got all emotional and you wouldn't have let me finish.
    So, here it is. When you get back home, Michael Lawler will give you access
    to a bank account that contains enough to give you a new beginning.
    Don't start panicking. It's not enough for you to sit around for the rest of
    your life. But it should buy you your freedom. At least from that little town
    we both call home. Live boldly, Clark. Push yourself. Don't settle.
    Wear those stripy legs with pride. Knowing you still have possibilities is a
    luxury. Knowing I might have given them to you has eased something for me.
    So, this is it. You are scored on my heart, Clark. You were from the first day
    you walked in with your sweet smile and your ridiculous clothes. And your bad
    jokes and your complete inability to ever hide a single thing you felt.
    Don't think of me too often. I don't want you getting sad. Just live well.
    Just live. I'll be walking beside you every step of the way. Love, Will.

    -- ME BEFORE YOU | Will write to Clark
